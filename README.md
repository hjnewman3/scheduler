# Scheduler

```
The problem:

We have a set of tasks, each running at least daily, which are scheduled with a simplified cron. We want to find 
when each of them will next run.

The scheduler configuration looks like this:

30 1 /bin/run_me_daily
45 * /bin/run_me_hourly
* * /bin/run_me_every_minute
* 19 /bin/run_me_sixty_times

The first field is the minutes past the hour, the second field is the hour of the day and the third is the command 
to run. For both cases * means that it should run for all values of that field. In the above example run_me_daily 
has been set to run at 1:30am every day and run_me_hourly at 45 minutes past the hour every hour. The fields are 
whitespace separated and each entry is on a separate line.

We would like you to write a command line program that outputs the soonest time at which each of the commands will 
run and whether this will be today or tomorrow.

The config input will be via STDIN, and the output should be via STDOUT. The 'current time' will be the single 
command line argument to the program in the format HH:MM.

For example given the above examples as input and the simulated 'current time' command-line argument 16:10 the 
output should be:

1:30 tomorrow - /bin/run_me_daily
16:45 today - /bin/run_me_hourly
16:10 today - /bin/run_me_every_minute
19:00 today - /bin/run_me_sixty_times
```

# Installation
This program makes use of the stdin() and stdout() of the Python sys Module. No specialy dependencies should be required 
to run it.

# Usage
I've supplied a test scheduler configuration file to mimic the input as given in the program requirements

## To execute the program
```bash
cat input_config.txt | python scheduler.py 16:10
```
